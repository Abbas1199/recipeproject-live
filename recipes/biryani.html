    <p>it is very tasty and yummy especially if "cooked". There are a lot of variation
         in the biryani but people who eat vegetable biryani are the absolute non humans .</p>
     <p>Chicken Biryani is a delicious savory rice dish that is loaded with spicy marinated chicken, 
    caramelized onions, and flavorful saffron rice. For my Biryani, I simplify the order of operations,
     while retaining the traditional layered approach to assembling it.
